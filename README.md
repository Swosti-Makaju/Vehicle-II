A vehicle rental system is a digital platform or software solution designed to facilitate the process of renting vehicles to customers. The vehicle rental industry has seen a significant increase in demand due to its convenience, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility. Velorent, a vehicle rental company, offers an array of motorbikes, cars, and scooters for rent to cater to different customer preferences and needs. This project aims to develop a comprehensive vehicle rental system tailored specifically for Velorent as part of a college project.# Vehicle-Rental

The system, named Velorent, is dedicated to providing seamless and reliable transportation solutions. It specializes in the rental of motorbikes, cars, and scooters, offering a wide range of vehicles tailored to meet diverse customer needs. The project emphasizes safety, affordability, and convenience while ensuring transparent pricing and flexibility for users.

The primary objectives of this project are to:

Provide a user-friendly interface that ensures ease of use for both customers and administrators.

Implement efficient booking management, allowing users to browse vehicles, make reservations, and manage their bookings.

Enable comprehensive reporting to track usage, revenue, and other key metrics.

To further enhance the platform, the system integrates a dynamic pricing algorithm that adjusts rental costs based on demand and availability, a recommendation algorithm that suggests vehicles according to user rental history and preferences, and an overdue fine calculation algorithm that determines penalties fairly depending on the type of vehicle and the duration of delay.
